# Question similarity model

Determine whether 2 questions are asking the same thing.




This project is to determine whether 2 questions on Quora are asking the same thing. This is to help reduce the load on the service by providing answers that are already in the system to similar questions. This can be applied to customer service FAQs or general question about a product, or service.

Notebooks are separated into exploration, cleaning, feature engineering and modelling.
